# Building
## Requirements
To build this program, you will need the following to be installed:
- SDL2 development library
- GLEW development library
- g++
- make
You will also need to clone the directory by running: 
```git clone git@github.com:Malc01m/Traveller.git```
Then, run `make` from within the cloned directory.
This will also begin program execution.
For future use, the compiled executable will be located at `./build/Traveller`.
